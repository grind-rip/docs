## [Heaps](./heaps.md)
A heap is a binary tree in which each element has a key (or sometimes priority) that is less than (or greater than) the keys of its children. This property is called the heap property or heap invariant. Heaps are used to implement priority queues.

## [Linked Lists](./linked_lists.md)
A linked list is a data structure where elements (often called nodes) are connected in a sequence, with each node containing both data and a reference (or "pointer") to the next node in the sequence.
